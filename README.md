# Exchange rate calculator
## Let me introduce you into the project
Very simple exchange rate calculator, which uses https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ API to get current data.

### Live demo

https://pasiastazebra.github.io/exchangerate/

### Very important note
>[!WARNING]
>Due to fact, that I'm not into backend right now, I used API key on the front side and I'm getting data directly from the API.
>**DO NOT USE YOUR API KEY LIKE THAT**<sup> and it would be super nice, if you won't overload my request limit lmao</sup>

## How to set up the project
```
git clone https://github.com/pasiastazebra/exchangerate

```
And that's all. It's just a plain HCS.ðŸ‘¾
